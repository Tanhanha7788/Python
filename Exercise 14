The arithmetic sequence is given with the following formula:



Calculate the sum of the first ten elements of this sequence. Print the result to the console as shown below.



Expected result:



The sum of the first 10 elements in a sequence: 320.0




a1 = 14
a10 = 50
n = 10
s10 = ((a1 + a10) / 2) * n
print(f'The sum of the first 10 elements in a sequence: {s10}')
