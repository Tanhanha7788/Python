MAE - Mean Absolute Error is a function that allows you to check the accuracy of the machine learning model. MAE is popular in regression models.

MAE can be calculated by the following formula

answer:

def mae(y_true, y_pred):
    return round(
        sum([abs(i[1] - i[0]) for i in zip(y_true, y_pred)]) / len(y_true),
        3,
    )
