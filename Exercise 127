Implement a function called multi(), which accepts an iterable object (list, tuple) as an argument and returns the product of all elements of this iterable object.



Example:



[IN]: multi((-4, 6, 2))
[OUT]: -48


[IN]: multi([4, 2, -5])
[OUT]: -40


Answer:

def multi(numbers):
    result = 1
    for number in numbers:
        result *= number
    return result
